# CppTutorials

## Welcome!

So below is the general overview of the C++ tutorials I've made for you! For each tutorial below you will find:
  - A link to the youtube video of the actual tutorial
  - A link to the code within this github which you can download and run yourself
    - The code might look slightly different to how its shown within the tutorial as I will add comments describing what was covered within the tutorial and maybe add some extra pieces to ensure that everything is explained as best as I can explain it!
  - A brief description of what the tutorial is covering
  
If anything is not clear please feel free to create an issue so that myself and others can help! All questions, when answered, will then be put in an FAQ within the Wiki so that people can look through at their own pace or even further tutorials made to cover these things!

The main goal of this is to help you on your C++ journey, and I really do hope this helps! If possible though, please consider helping my maintain this page and develop more in detailed guides for you by donating a small amount! I live in Milan, IT so a coffee/espresso for me is only â‚¬1! Even smaller amounts will be highly appreciated and you will have my utmost thanks! However, if you are not able to then no worries! As long as this page, myself, and the community has been able to guide you within the abyss that is C++ :)
